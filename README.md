# Pizza-Sales-Report
In my SQL-based Pizza Sales Data Analysis project, I created and managed a database by importing tables and CSV data, enabling structured data analysis. I utilized SQL queries to calculate the total number of orders placed, analyze order details and pricing, and determine the highest-priced pizza. By employing JOINs and subqueries, I linked tables to extract meaningful insights, such as identifying the top five most ordered pizza types and their quantities. I leveraged aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT) along with GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses to categorize orders, analyze pizza sales distribution, and determine revenue contributions of different pizza types. Furthermore, I calculated the percentage revenue distribution using SQL subqueries and extracted key order details to optimize business decisions.
